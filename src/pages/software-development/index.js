                            <h3 className=" mt-6 text-[22px] font-normal">What Is Software Development?</h3>
                            <p className="mt-4">Software development is not an ordinary system; instead, it is a complex system and comprises a series of steps requiring expertise. Here is how it is defined:</p>
                            <div className="mt-10 max-w-[600px] mx-auto">
                                <Accordion title="Step No 1: Identification Of Needs">
                                    This is a specific research-based step and holds primary importance. It revolves wholly around the identification of the needs of the brand and involves extensive marketing research and brainstorming. Our team of experts does in-depth market research first and then the brand's needs so that the target market gets what they are looking for. Remember, we also discuss the brand's aspects, including strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities.
                                    Pro Tip: The best way to do this is to get feedback from potential and old customers
                                </Accordion>
                                <Accordion title="Step No 2: Analysis Of Requirements">The second step in software development is the in-depth analysis of the requirements. In fact, this is very crucial in the development of software as it decides the fate of the software. The developers at this time determine the software development approach, such as a waterfall or V model. Moreover, the developers decide on the detailed outline of every component, scope, testing parameters, and task details of the developers to ensure the delivery of a quality product.</Accordion>
                                <Accordion title="Step No 3: Design">The third stage of the software development process is the design phase. The developers, at this point, come up with advanced specifications that are required to create the software. What else? Risk levels, time, budget, limitations, technologies, and designs are also considered. Actually, this step is a template that minimizes the chances of delays and flaws.</Accordion>
                                <Accordion title="Step No 4: Developing And Implementation">After the design is complete, the next step is developing and implementing the parameters of the design. The product specifications and requirements decided in the third step are coded at this stage. Besides, the front-end developers design interfaces and back-ends, and at the same time, the administrators add relevant data to the database. After being done with the coding, the developers then implement the product into the environment as part of the testing. This helps us see whether the performance is as per the requirements.</Accordion>
                                <Accordion title="Step No 5: Testing">At this phase, it's time to test the software for bugs. Adding more to this, the verification is done before it can be delivered to the users. Our expert testers verify the product's functions and ensure its performance is according to the requirements. If there is any defect in the code, the testers notify the developers. They work on the software, improve and repeat the process until it is ready.</Accordion>
                                <Accordion title="Step No 6: Deployment & Maintenance">When the software is defect-free, it's ready to deliver to the customers. Once it is released, we create a maintenance team to manage all the issues the clients encounter while using the product.</Accordion>
                            </div>

                                Adding more to it, the whole cycle consisting of methodologies used to develop the software is known as Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), an international standard used by software houses globally to develop and optimize the software per the brand's needs.
                                We use the Waterfall model for SDLC. Here are the seven main steps included in it that lead to a particular, tailor-made software:
